### Backend

The server is written with Express. User details and blog entries are saved in a MongoDB database. Mongoose is utilized as the ORM. 
Blog entries are attached to their account specifically using JSON Web token and stored in MongoDB. User passwords are encrypted and stored in MongoDB using the BcryptJS package.
